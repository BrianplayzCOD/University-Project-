            <h2>How to make your call of duty experience better</h2>
            <h3>You may be wondering why ever time you keep failing in your Battle Royale match's. Normally it may be just be skill issue, But something it's just the game setting's.</h3>

            <h4>For example:</h4>
            <!--examples-->
            <ul>
                <li>Knowing the different maps inside and out can really help if you're playing modes other than team deathmatch.</li>
                <li>Pay attention to spawning points.</li>
                <li>Sucks but you gotta lone wolf and get destroyed.</li>

                It helped me and most other players. I wasn’t a “badass” I was just always in a position, back in the MW2 BF3 era, of being outnumbered by clans all the time. I had friends and everything, but most the time after school or work, I was alone gaming on my downtime.
                
                There were times where even my entire team lagged out and I still won. I played as if I had 1 life and I was in the game. That helped a lot surprisingly. Then my focs went away from the victory, to the fight.
                
                Most people in gaming want to win, but don’t want to bask in the beauty of battle. That mentality of being in the battle slows down time and allows for creative thinking.
                
                One last thing, trllling helps. When you troll, you are playing around. Evident by kids, playing is a form of self-education, which is why kids play. When you play in the game, you start to learn things most people ignore.
                
                For instance, I hid behind a carepacking and let an enemy take it. When the box vanished, all he saw was me and I knifed him, while wearing a ghillie suit in BO1. In another scenario, trolling with the Ballistic Knife and Crossbow has actually made me very good. I went from a troll to some guy not to screw with.</li>
